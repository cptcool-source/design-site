## Design System — Direction C (Active)

**Color tokens** (defined in `:root` in `style.css`):

| Token | Value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--bg` | `#FAFAF8` | Page background — warm off-white, not pure white |
| `--surface` | `#F2F0ED` | Card / section backgrounds |
| `--surface-raised` | `#ECEAE6` | Elevated card states |
| `--accent` | `#E05C3A` | Coral — primary accent, logo "Tech", CTAs |
| `--accent-light` | `#F07A5A` | Hover states on coral elements |
| `--accent-dark` | `#B84928` | Active / pressed coral states |
| `--text` | `#111111` | Body copy — near-black |
| `--text-muted` | `#6B6965` | Secondary copy, captions |
| `--text-faint` | `#BBBAB6` | Placeholder, disabled states |
| `--border` | `rgba(0,0,0,0.08)` | Default borders |
| `--border-mid` | `rgba(0,0,0,0.13)` | Stronger dividers, focused inputs |

**Typography — Direction C (active):**
- Display / UI: Outfit 800 — hero headline, section titles, logo wordmark
- Light contrast: Outfit 300 — `"made to"` midline in hero, creates weight tension
- Accent: Outfit 300 italic — `"lead."` in coral, the emotional close
- Utility: Geist Mono — eyebrows, location tags, small labels
- Body: Outfit 400/500 — readable at 16px, inherits from the display family

**Key animations:**
- Hero headline: `fade-up` — slides up 24px with opacity 0→1 (0.9s, ease-out, 0.3s delay)
- Hero sub + CTA: staggered `fade-up` at 0.9s and 1.1s delay
- Scroll reveals: `.reveal-up` via IntersectionObserver — 40px upward drift into opacity
- Film slate ticker: horizontal infinite scroll marquee
- Process rail: `--fill-h` CSS var driven by scroll position, charging left-to-right
- Nav: background + border fade-in on scroll past 60px

## Switchable Design Directions

A theme switcher widget (bottom-right corner, **remove before going live**) lets you compare three type directions by clicking A / B / C. Change `data-theme="a"` on the `<html>` element to make a direction permanent.

| Direction | Display Font | Body Font | Character |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | Cormorant Garamond | DM Sans | Editorial luxury serif — cinematic, high contrast |
| B | Clash Display | General Sans | Bold studio grotesque — uppercase, geometric |
| **C (active)** | Outfit (variable weight) | Outfit | Weight tension — 800 vs 300 in the same typeface |

## Visual Identity & Layout

### Brand Concept

fixedIT Tech is not an agency. It is a skilled local operator who builds things that work. The visual identity reflects that: confidence without posturing, precision without coldness, warmth earned through restraint rather than decoration.

**Core metaphor:** Precision craft meets Gulf Coast light. The weight contrast in the logo — "fixedIT" at 800, "Tech" in coral — is the whole brand idea in two words: authority, then warmth.

**What the design avoids:** Dark-mode SaaS clichés. Generic beach imagery. Luxury signaling that would alienate a plumber or restaurant owner. Anything that says "startup" instead of "professional."

---

### Color System

Three colors carry the entire site.

**`#FAFAF8` — Warm Off-White (base)**
Not pure white. The warmth comes from a faint yellow-gray undertone that reads as paper or plaster — coastal architecture, not a screen. Used as the page background and hero text color (inverted against dark).

**`#111111` — Near-Black (text)**
Not pure black. Slightly warm, which keeps it readable without the harshness of `#000`. Used for all body copy, headings in light sections, and the dark hero background.

**`#E05C3A` — Coral (accent)**
The single warm note. Appears in: the "Tech" half of the logo, every CTA button, the eyebrow dot, hover states on links and cards, the about section em tags, and footer accents. It is earned — used precisely so it always means *action* or *identity*, never decoration.

**Grain texture** (CSS `body::after`): a subtle SVG fractalNoise overlay at 2.2% opacity. Keeps the off-white from reading as flat digital white. Barely perceptible but removes the sterile quality.

---

### Typography System

Outfit is a variable-weight geometric sans. The identity uses its full weight spectrum — not as a gimmick, but as the primary visual contrast mechanism.

| Role | Weight | Size | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hero primary | 800 | `clamp(56px, 13vw, 192px)` | "Designs" — the dominant word |
| Hero secondary | 300 | same scale, 42% opacity | "made to" — recedes, creates depth |
| Hero accent | 300 italic, coral | same scale | "lead." — emotional close |
| Section titles | 800 | `clamp(28px, 4.5vw, 52px)` | All `h2` headings |
| Card titles | 700 | `clamp(17px, 1.8vw, 20px)` | Service / work card headings |
| Body | 400 | 16px / line-height 1.6 | All prose |
| Eyebrows | Geist Mono 500 | 11–12px, tracked +0.08em | Location tags, section labels |
| Nav | 800 (logo) / 500 (links) | 18px / 15px | Navigation |

**The weight rule:** 800 announces, 300 breathes, 400 delivers. Never use medium (500–700) for display — it sits in no-man's land between functional and expressive.

### Layout — Section by Section

#### Navigation (`site-nav`)
Fixed, full-width. Transparent on load; gains `background: rgba(250,250,248,0.9)` + blur + border-bottom when scrolled past 60px. Left: logo lockup. Center: five text links. Right: coral CTA button "Get a free quote." Mobile: hamburger opens a full-height right-side drawer. The nav never competes with the hero — it disappears visually until the user needs it.

#### Hero (`hero`)
The site's only dark section. `#111` background. Full viewport height. Content is vertically centered with slight upward bias.

- **Background:** `.hero-photo` — empty div reserved for a background image (currently none; orbs provide atmosphere). Three `.orb` elements: CSS radial-gradient blobs in coral and muted warm tones that drift slowly via keyframe animation.
- **Eyebrow:** Geist Mono label with a pulsing coral dot. `"Web Design · North Port, FL 34291"` — establishes location immediately.
- **Headline:** Three-line stacked lockup. Weight contrast creates hierarchy without needing size variation:
  - Line 1: "Designs" — Outfit 800, off-white
  - Line 2: "made to" — Outfit 300, 42% opacity
  - Line 3: "lead." — Outfit 300 italic, coral
- **Sub:** One sentence. White, muted. Reveals on delay after headline.
- **CTAs:** Two buttons — primary (coral fill) "Get a free quote", ghost (white border) "See our work".
- **The hero rule** (Direction A only): hidden in Direction C. The weight-contrast headline replaces it.

#### Film Slate (`.film-slate`)
Full-width horizontal ticker immediately below hero. White background, small Geist Mono text. Scrolls continuously left: business name, location, services, target industries. Purely functional — reinforces local SEO signals visually. Breaks the hero-to-services transition without a hard line.

#### Services (`services`)
Light section (`--bg`). Asymmetric grid: one large featured card spanning 2 columns (Web Design), two standard cards in the right column, then three standard cards below. Each card has a Phosphor duotone icon, title, and description. Featured card additionally has a bullet list.

Card behavior: no border at rest. On hover, a coral gradient border appears via CSS `background-clip: padding-box` + `::before` pseudo-element with `mask` — the border gradient only, no fill bleed.

#### Process (`process`)
Light section with a vertical rail running down the left side of the step list. The rail fills from top as the user scrolls — a CSS custom property `--fill-h` is updated via `IntersectionObserver` + `requestAnimationFrame`, driving a coral-filled `::before` pseudo-element. Each step node (circle) activates when its step enters the viewport. Four steps: Consult → Design → Build → Launch.

#### Work / Portfolio (`work`)
Three horizontal work-type cards (Restaurants, Home Services, Health & Professional) each with an icon, eyebrow, headline, description, and "Get a free quote →" link. Below a full-width divider ("Selected work"), a horizontal portfolio rail of project cards: Mamba Tech Solutions, Family Hub, Family Hub Fun Zone. Each portfolio card has a screenshot, tag, title, and description. Clicking opens a lightbox with zoom.

#### About (`about`)
Two-column layout. Left: content — section title, blockquote, two paragraphs, email link. Right: portrait photo of Charles + family, "Serving" label, city pill list, local note. The blockquote (`"Design without strategy is decoration. / Strategy without design is invisible."`) is the brand's philosophical statement — Outfit 500 italic, oversized, borderless.

#### Contact (`contact`)
Dark-accent-free. Clean form on the left (name, email, phone, industry select, message textarea), aside on the right (email, location, response time, promise chip). Form submits to Formspree via AJAX. On success: button text changes, success message appears inline. Coral accent on the submit button and active input borders.

#### Footer (`site-footer`)
Single-line. Logo left, copyright center, email right. No secondary nav, no social links, no padding bloat. The site ends when the content ends.

### Animation Language

**Principle:** Motion should feel like the page waking up, not performing for you.

| Animation | Behavior | Duration | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hero headline | `fade-up` — 24px rise + opacity | 0.9s ease-out | Page entry — the most important element lands first |
| Hero sub / CTA | Same, staggered +0.6s / +0.8s | 0.9s | Trail the headline, never compete |
| Scroll reveals | `.reveal-up` 40px rise | 0.7s ease-out | Sections breathe in as you scroll — never all at once |
| Process fill | Rail grows with scroll | Continuous | Progress metaphor — the page moves with you |
| Orbs | Slow radial drift (`float-*` keyframes) | 18–22s loop | Ambient warmth, not motion design |
| Film slate | Infinite left scroll | 28s loop | Utility — not decoration |
| Nav appearance | Opacity + blur on scroll | 0.3s | Functional — never distracting |
| Card border | Coral gradient on hover | 0.25s | Subtle confirmation of interactivity |

**What never animates:** Logo. Nav links. Body copy. Paragraph text. Anything inside a card at rest.

---

### Imagery Direction

The site currently uses three types of imagery:

**Portfolio screenshots** (`images/mamba-tech.png`, `images/family-hub-*.png`): Real work. Full-bleed inside portfolio cards. Shown in a lightbox on click. These are the most important images on the site — they prove capability.

**Portrait** (`images/family.png`): Charles and family. Humanizes the business. Placed in the About section alongside the city list. Should feel like a real person, not a headshot.

**Hero background** (`.hero-photo` div, currently empty): Reserved for a future image — ideally a cinematic editorial photograph. Direction below.

#### Imagery Direction for Future Assets

The site's visual language calls for images that feel like **warm precision** — not beach tourism, not generic office stock.

**What to shoot / source:**
- Cinematic afternoon light on clean white architecture (stucco, painted block, clean facades)
- Strong directional shadows — the graphic quality of Southwest Florida noon or golden-hour light
- Close-ups of craft: clean workspace, quality materials, a well-built thing
- Storefronts of the kinds of businesses fixedIT Tech serves — a well-lit restaurant patio, a clean HVAC truck, a medical office entry
- Warm palette: terracotta, sand, coral accent objects, deep shadow
- No people unless they are real (Charles, actual clients)

**What to avoid:**
- Generic beach / palm tree / Gulf scenery
- Laptop-on-a-beach stock clichés
- Smiling-businesspeople stock photos
- Dark moody tech imagery (this is a light-mode site serving local business owners)
- Anything that reads as "startup" or "Silicon Valley"

**Hero image spec:** 1920×1080 minimum. Dark treatment (darken overlay or naturally dark scene) so off-white headline type remains legible. Horizontal composition with visual weight on the right half, leaving left clear for the text stack.

---

### Brand Voice

**In copy:** Direct. Short sentences. No buzzwords. Never "leverage," "synergy," "solutions," "cutting-edge." Speak like a skilled local business owner, not a marketing consultant.

**Sentence rhythm:** Lead with a verb or a specific fact. `"Show up first when customers search."` Not `"We help you achieve greater visibility in local search results."`

**Headlines:** Action or consequence. Not description. `"Sites that fill tables."` Not `"Restaurant web design services."`

**About tone:** First person occasionally but mostly second — speak to the client's outcome, not the business's process. The one exception is the origin story paragraph where "we" is appropriate.

### Prompt to Recreate Direction C

> Marketing website for fixedIT Tech, a local web design studio in North Port, FL. Light mode: warm off-white (#FAFAF8) base, near-black (#111) text, coral (#E05C3A) accent. Single dark section: the hero. Outfit variable-weight sans — the headline stacks three lines using weight 800, then 300 at 42% opacity, then 300 italic in coral. The weight contrast is the visual. No decorative elements in the hero — three ambient orbs provide warmth. Sections reveal on scroll via IntersectionObserver. Service cards get a coral gradient border on hover using CSS mask technique. Process section has a rail that fills as you scroll. Film slate ticker below hero. Portfolio cards in a horizontal scroll rail with lightbox. About section with portrait + city pill list. Contact form via Formspree. Footer is one line. Feels like a skilled local tradesperson's portfolio, not an agency deck. Confident, warm, precise.

---

## Logo System

**Logo Direction:** Pixel Wordmark — "fixediT Tech" in Outfit Extra Bold. "Tech" rendered in coral (#E05C3A). The lowercase **i** dot is stylized as a filled square pixel — a craft signal readable at display scale that ties the wordmark to the precision-craft brand positioning.

**Figma source file:** `fixedIT Tech — Logo System` (file key: `JMccvYFJyxryBSMJZTO61m`)  
Contains: primary dark/light wordmarks, one-color variants, scale tests (64→13px), fT favicon marks, OG image layout, color palette, type specimens.

**On-site logo files:**

| File | Use | Background |
|---|---|---|
| `images/favicon.svg` | Browser tab, bookmarks | — (32×32 SVG) |
| `images/logo-dark.svg` | Docs, decks, email signatures | Dark / #111 |
| `images/logo-light.svg` | Docs, decks, print | Light / white |
| `images/og-image.html` | Social preview source (screenshot at 1200×630) | — |

**Nav and footer logo** are CSS text (`fixediT<span> Tech</span>`) so Outfit 800 renders live on the page — no image swaps.

**Pixel i-dot implementation:** The square i-dot is a vector editing detail — apply in Figma by overlaying a filled rect at each "i" character's dot position. The logo SVG files use live SVG text (Outfit 800 via Google Fonts import) and render correctly in modern browsers. For print or rasterized exports, apply the pixel dot in the Figma source file and export as PNG/PDF.
